# JournelDataDrivenControlWithCBF

This repository contains the simulation code for our paper **"Data-Driven Control Based on Control Barrier Functions with Recursive Feasibility Guarantee"**.

## **Related Tools and Software**

### **Simulation Platform**
- MATLAB/Simulink **2024b** (recommended)
  
### **Required MATLAB Toolboxes**
The following MATLAB toolboxes are required to run the simulations:
- **Control System Toolbox**
- **Optimization Toolbox**
- **Parallel Computing Toolbox**
- **Robust Control Toolbox**
- **Automated Driving Toolbox**

### **Additional Required Toolboxes**
Please manually install the following toolboxes:
- **YALMIP**: [Download Here](https://yalmip.github.io/download/)
- **MOSEK**: [Download Here](https://www.mosek.com/downloads/)
- **MPT3**: [Installation Guide](https://www.mpt3.org/pmwiki.php/Main/Installation)

## **Setup Instructions**
Follow the steps below to set up the simulation environment:

1. Install **MATLAB/Simulink** (**2024b** recommended) along with the required toolboxes listed above.
2. Install the additional toolboxes (YALMIP, MOSEK, and MPT3) by following the provided links.
3. Download `Journal_DataDrivenControlWithCBF.zip` and extract it to obtain the folders `LK` and `ACC`.
4. Navigate to the `LK` folder and make sure it is the working directory. Then run `LK_Run.mlx` (The plotting code is in a separate mlx file, and `LK_Run` will call it).
5. Navigate to the `ACC` folder and make sure it is the working directory. Then run `ACC_Run.mlx` (The plotting code is in a separate mlx file, and `ACC_Run` will call it).
   
   (Note: Both the `LK` and `ACC` folders contain a file named `File.mat`, which stores the simulation data from the paper. You can directly load these files and use the plotting files to generate plots.)
